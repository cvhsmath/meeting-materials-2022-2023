     \noindent \textbf{Test Taking Strategies}
     \begin{itemize}
          \item Try Solving the problem first
          \item Substitute answer choices
          \item Try to find patterns with smaller numbers
          \item Use your tools
           \begin{itemize}
               \item You can use rulers, compasses, and protractors to draw and estimate lengths and angle measure. Be aware that picture problems are not drawn exactly to scale
               \item Use graph paper to graph equations to estimate possible solutions
          \end{itemize}
          \item Eliminate some options 
          \begin{itemize}
               \item narrow down to 1 choice to find the solution
               \item increase probability of guesses
          \end{itemize}
          \item Last resort is to guess
          \item NEVER LEAVE A QUESTION BLANK, you won't be penalized; you can only benefit

     \noindent \textbf{Systems of equations}\\
     A system of equations is a set of equations which share the same variables. Below is an example of a system of equations.
     \begin{itemize}
          \item Elimination
          \begin{itemize}
               \item  Elimination involves eliminating variables from the system by adding constant multiples of two or more of the equations together. Let's look at an example:

               Problem
               Find the ordered pair $(x,y)$ for which
               
               \[\left\{\begin{array}{l}x-12y=2\\3x+6y=6\end{array}\right.\]
               Solution
               We can eliminate $y$ by adding twice the second equation to the first:
               
               $x - 12y= 2$
               $+2($	$3x + 6y = 6)$
               simplifying we get ${7x + 0=14}$
               Thus $x=2$. We can then plug in for $x$ in either of the equations:\begin{align*} (2)-12y &= 2 \\ y &= 0 \end{align*}
               Thus, the solution to the system is $(2,0)$.
          \end{itemize}
          \item Substitution
          \begin{itemize}
               \item Substitution requires solving for a variable and then plugging that variable into another equation therefore reducing the number of variables. We'll show how to solve the same problem from the elimination section using substitution.

               Problem
               Find the ordered pair $(x,y)$ for which
               
               \[\left\{\begin{array}{l}x-12y=2\\3x+6y=6\end{array}\right.\]
               Solution
               The first equation can be solved for $x$:
               
               $x = 12y + 2.$
               Plugging this into the second equation yields
               
               $3(12y + 2) + 6y = 6 \Leftrightarrow 42 y = 0.$
               Thus $y=0$. Plugging this into either of the equations and solving for $x$ yields $x=2$.
          \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}

     \noindent \textbf{Sum of geometric sequences}
     \begin{itemize}
          \item In algebra, a geometric sequence, sometimes called a geometric progression, is a sequence of numbers such that the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant is called the common ratio of the sequence.

          For example, $1, 2, 4, 8$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $2$ and $100, -50, 25, -25/2$ is a geometric sequence with common ratio $-1/2$; however, $1, 3, 9, -27$ and $-3, 1, 5, 9, \ldots$ are not geometric sequences, as the ratio between consecutive terms varies.
          
          More formally, the sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n$ is a geometric progression if and only if $a_2 / a_1 = a_3 / a_2 = \cdots = a_n / a_{n-1}$. A similar definition holds for infinite geometric sequences. It appears most frequently in its three-term form: namely, that constants $a$, $b$, and $c$ are in geometric progression if and only if $b / a = c / b$.
          \item Finite
          \begin{itemize}
               \item A finite geometric series with first term $a_1$, common ratio $r$ not equal to one, and $n$ total terms has a value equal to $\frac{a_1(r^n-1)}{r-1}$.
          \end{itemize}
          \item Infinite 
          \begin{itemize}
               \item An infinite geometric series converges if and only if $|r|<1$; if this condition is satisfied, the series converges to $\frac{a_1}{1-r}$.
          \end{itemize}
     \end{itemize}

     \noindent \textbf{Guessing Strategies}
     \begin{itemize}
          \item If you canâ€™t solve, here are some tips on guessing
          \item Sometimes you can eliminate
          \begin{itemize}
               \item answer choices too large or too small
               \item answer choices odd or even
               \item answer choices divisible by $x$
          \end{itemize}
          \item In geometry problems, estimate the dimensions
          \begin{itemize}
               \item figures are not to scale, but they are close
               \item Graph paper, rulers, and protractors are allowed
          \end{itemize}
          \item Make sure to mark an answer for every problem($20\%$ chance of getting it right)
        \end{itemize}
